# Real-Estate
Course-end Project 1

**Problem Statement**
 

* A banking institution requires actionable insights into mortgage-backed securities, geographic business investment, and real estate analysis. 
* The mortgage bank would like to identify potential monthly mortgage expenses for each region based on monthly family income and rental of the real estate.
* A statistical model needs to be created to predict the potential demand in dollars amount of loan for each of the region in the USA. Also, there is a need to create a dashboard which would refresh periodically post data retrieval from the agencies.
* The dashboard must demonstrate relationships and trends for the key metrics as follows: number of loans, average rental income, monthly mortgage and ownerâ€™s cost, family income vs mortgage cost comparison across different regions. The metrics described here do not limit the dashboard to these few.
